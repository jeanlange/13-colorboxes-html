# representing colors in CSS
Multiple ways to specify colors
1. by name - best for quick specification/experimentation to see something
2. oct / hex - # followed by 3 or 6 digits from 0-f, each third represents red, green, blue
3. rgb format - rgb(red-value, green-value, blue-value)

## color systems
1. rgb - light
2. color names
3. cmyk - pigment
4. red blue yellow

# protips
* use the inspector to do experiments - save the good result into your code


# number representations
You can represent a number in different ways.

Roman numerals - X
decimal / base 10 - 10
binary / base 2 - 1010
hexadecimal / base 16 - a

base 10: 5293
'places' - each place is a power of 10
multiply the digit in that place by the place value and add them all up
5 * 1000 + 2 * 100 + 9 * 10 + 3 * 1

13
base 10: 1 * 10 + 3 * 1
    13
base 2: 1 * 8 + 1 * 4 + 0 * 2 + 1 * 1
    1101
base 3: 1 * 9 + 1*3 + 1*1
    111
base 16: '13'=d * 1
    d

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f


largest number in hex
1*16 + 16*16 + 256*16 + ... 16^6
0..16777216.to_hex = hex color

# layout

* the walls of the house
* the format for displaying on the page
* how it's arranged
* rows, columns, sections
* overlapping sticky notes
* blueprint <-- wireframe
